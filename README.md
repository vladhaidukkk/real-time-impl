# Long Polling, Server-Sent Events, and WebSocket Demo

This project demonstrates various techniques for implementing Real-Time Communication between a Client and a Server using Python and JavaScript. Real-time communication is essential for applications that require instant data updates, such as chat applications, live notifications, and collaborative tools.

In this demo, we explore three different methods of achieving real-time communication:

-  **Long Polling**: A technique where the client requests information from the server and holds the connection open until the server has new information to send. Once the server responds, the client immediately sends a new request.

-  **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: A standard allowing servers to push updates to the client over a single HTTP connection. This is a simpler alternative to WebSockets for certain use cases where one-way communication from the server to the client is sufficient.

-  **WebSocket**: A protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. WebSockets are ideal for applications that require continuous data exchange between the client and server.
